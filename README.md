## General info

Code used for detecting inquiry calls produced during flight tests

## Analysis

* [Calling activity results](https://rpubs.com/marcelo-araya-salas/624039) 

## In progress


## To-do list

* Detecting with 2 or 3 different templates
* Cure current detections
* Repeatibility of calling rate (**groups** and individuals)
* Calling rate along recordings
* Call individuality within groups based on acoustic structure
* Indetifying individuals in group flight
* Control for noise level (adjust SNR on low noise recs)
* Measure signal structure

## Status
Project is: _in progress_
